## Scope of the project
To achieve the client's objective, the team shall develop a design of an optical inspection system assembly for semiconductor applications. This optical system should be a microscope-type which is capable of inspecting surfaces. For this, an optical design is required combined with ACS controller and camera, to enable focusing on the surface under inspection. The selection of optical components and focusing hardware along with the development of a CAD model of the assembly is required to complete the scope. The team will be responsible for conducting a literature review to figure out the best approach, explore the available technologies, and develop system architecture for the solution.
The other scope is to create a Python shell that can be used to execute tests on the gantry system. This concerns the creation of Python scripts that can communicate with the ACS controller and camera in the gantry setup via standardized libraries/protocols. 

- Camera, Lens, and Lighting:
In this phase of the project, we will undertake a thorough examination of camera, lens, and lighting components. Our goal is to shortlist and configure these critical elements in the optical system. This process involves a meticulous comparative analysis of different options, taking into account factors such as resolution, focal length, aperture, and illumination intensity. The outcome of this analysis will lead to well-informed recommendations for the selection of specific components that align precisely with the project's requirements. Additionally, we will obtain CAD models of the chosen components, ensuring design compatibility.

- Focusing Technology:
Another aspect of the optical system is the focusing technology. We shortlisted existing focusing technologies available in the market. Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth comparison of these technologies, considering factors like speed, accuracy, and adaptability to the inspection task. The objective is to make a well-informed decision regarding the final selection of the focusing method and associated components. This choice will significantly impact the system's performance, ensuring the utmost precision and reliability in surface inspection.

- Mechanical Frame and Mounting:
In the realm of mechanical design, our focus will be on creating a robust and meticulously engineered frame that seamlessly integrates all the selected components. Our scope in the project is limited to delivering CAD design of the optical inspection system. The mechanical frame design plays a pivotal role in ensuring stability, accuracy, and longevity. This phase of the project will involve careful planning, precise measurements, and the consideration of material choices to construct a frame that can withstand the demands of the inspection process. By designing a solid mechanical frame, we ensure the alignment and coordination of all the elements within the system, thus contributing to its overall functionality and reliability.
In summary, the project scope within "Optics and Illumination" involves a comprehensive evaluation of camera, lens, lighting, and focusing technology components, with a strong emphasis on comparative analysis to make informed selections. On the other hand, "Mechanical Frame and Mounting" encompasses the design and construction of a sturdy frame that will serve as the foundation for integrating these components. These endeavors are crucial steps toward achieving a reliable and high-precision surface inspection system.

- Python Communication:
To control the motion of the gantry stage, NTS uses SPiiPlus motion controller from ACS. It is designed to meet the needs of OEMs with demanding multi-axis motion control applications. The SPiiPlus Motion Control Platform controls ACS products in the and 3rd party EtherCAT devices, providing flexibility for the motion control system designer. ACS supports Modbus communication which is a request-response protocol implemented using a master-slave relationship. In a master-slave relationship, communication always occurs in pairs where one device must initiate a request and then wait for a responseâ€”and the initiating device (the master) is responsible for initiating every interaction. The Modbus protocol uses character serial communication lines, Ethernet, or the Internet protocol suite as a transport layer. 
Using the pyModbus library, we can communicate via Modbus with ACS controller using the python. Pymodbus is a full Modbus protocol implementation using a synchronous or asynchronous core.

- Client, connect to your favorite device
- item Server, simulate your favorite device
- Repl, a text based client/server simulator 
- Simulator, a html based server simulator
  
To test the repeatability of an X-Y gantry machine, several steps are required using precision measurement tools and software. First, we select the test points after we determine a set of test points that cover the range of motion and positions the gantry machine will operate in. These points should be spaced out to evaluate repeatability across the entire workspace. Then, after ensuring that the gantry machine is set up correctly and initialized at zero position to establish a reference point. Then, precision measurement tools are used to measure the actual position of the gantry at each test point. Execute a test sequence where the gantry machine moves to each of the predefined test points and stops. Record the actual position of the gantry machine at each point. After making adjustments or performing maintenance, re-run the repeatability test to verify that the improvements have been achieved.
